# TruckTracker
This was a project created for DeltaHacks 2019. 

## The Problem
The problem we tackled at this hackathon was the increasing theft of trucks and trailers from companies across Canada. One of those companies, Canada Cartage, estimates that this lose totals $5 billion per year and is mainly attributed to organized crime. By stealing trucks on the road and trailers in trucking yards, these thieves are able to bypass basic anti-theft sensors and security to steal valuable goods. We looked to reduce this lose by preventing or mitigating theft using a software program inaccessible by people on the ground.

## Our Solution
Using the Google Maps API in conjunction with telemetry data from trucks (provided to us by Canada Cartage), we were able to create a program that can detect when trucks deviate from their routes. At such an occurrence, companies are alerted to a possible theft and the company can contact the truck's operator or authorities if necessary. This is all packaged together in a simple interface that is easy to understand and use. To help us demo our solution, we implemented a simple game/simulation to visually show how the program works.

## Future Goals
As of now, the application is separated into various modules that work well individually but not together. Due to time constraints, this ended up becoming a future goal for us. To merge these modules together, we would need to implement a robust backend to connect all the components, as well as a database to assist in storing data collected by the program.

## Skills Learned
From using the Google Maps API to Pygame, there were a lot of things learned throughout the development of this project for each member of the group. It was great to be able to explore such a novel problem and get the chance to brainstorm and implement a solution! All in all, a great time!
